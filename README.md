### 1 Introduction

The codes and data for the paper 'Large-scale hybrid task scheduling in cloud-edge collaborative manufacturing systems with FCRN-assisted random differential evolution' published in the journal named 'The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology'. The paper can be found at: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-023-12595-4

The codes contain both the proposed FCRN-RDE and an implementation of several evolution algorithms. Some codes are converted from C++ programs so that parts of them may look a little bit strange. 

### 2 Run

To run the program, just execute:

```python
python main.py
```

The codes are simple but may be really effective in solving some large-scale optimization problems.

GOOD LUCK FOR YOUR RESEARCH!
